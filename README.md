R code and data to accompany analyticsvidhya's Data Science Tutorial

This tutorial is to introduce new and old users of R to the world of Data Science!
I enjoyed the Tutorial provided here: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-scratch/

Thus, I decided to transfer the tutorial completely into R, with the attatched Files you need for the more analytical part of the tutorial.

Enjoy and feel free to improve on it!
